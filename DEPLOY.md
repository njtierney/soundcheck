# Deployment Instructions

This app is set up to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using Shinylive whenever you push to the `main` branch.

## Initial Setup (One-time)

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/njtierney/soundcheck/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select **GitHub Actions**
3. Save the settings

### 2. Push your code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add shinylive deployment workflow"
git push
```

### 3. Wait for deployment

- Go to the Actions tab: https://github.com/njtierney/soundcheck/actions
- Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages with Shinylive" workflow run
- Once complete (green check), your app will be live!

## Accessing Your App

After successful deployment, your app will be available at:

**https://njtierney.github.io/soundcheck/**

## How It Works

1. **You edit**: `R/ui.R` and `R/server.R` (your source files)
2. **GitHub Action automatically**:
   - Runs `build_app.R` to combine them into `app/app.R`
   - Exports to shinylive format using `shinylive::export()`
   - Deploys the static site to GitHub Pages
3. **Result**: Live app at the URL above

## Local Testing

Before pushing, you can test the deployment process locally:

```r
# Build the app.R file
source("build_app.R")

# Export to shinylive
shinylive::export("app", "site")

# Preview locally (optional)
servr::httd("site")
```

## Workflow File

The GitHub Action workflow is defined in:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-shinylive.yaml`

## What's Ignored

The following are gitignored (generated automatically):
- `app/` - Generated by build_app.R
- `site/` - Generated by shinylive::export()

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled (see step 1 above)
3. Verify the workflow has proper permissions
4. Test locally using the commands above
